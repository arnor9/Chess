# Chess
Implement the hierarchy of classes and corresponding logic needed to have the "Chess" program listed below properly functioning. The program is properly functioning when it prints a long sequence of Test passed!.

You are not allowed to alter in any way the provided main method. The program must properly determine the validity of possible positions of pieces on a Chess board. We assume no other pieces are on the board. The moves to check correspond to moves of king, rook, bishop, knight, and pawn. For further information you can visit the Chess entry on Wikipedia.
